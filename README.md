Karabiner Elements configuration for macOS with support for num lock toggle. 
Use the keypad as a number keypad and window snapper using num lock toggle.

When I find the person who made this, I'll add them in.

## Software
[Karabiner-Elements]("https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org")

[Rectangle]("https://rectangleapp.com")

## Install
1. Add key.json to `~/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications/`
2. Enable in Karabiner-Elements under 'Complex Modifications'

## Note
I have changed some of the default keymaps on karabiner, so make sure to change some keymaps before implementing this.
